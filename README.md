# smartcontracts
These combined make up the lending protocol. The token is just the token. The lending smart contract handles all the applications, reviews, profiling, funding, repayment, withdrawals by the platform users. The Vaults are needed for collateral, to begin with we are using an ERC20 token vault for pre Beta testing. It can receive and allocate rights to collateral, as owner. The next step is to make it capable of locking the assigned collateral, then creating a referencable profile for the lending smart contract to be able to read. The custodial vault is the only MIT standard template contract in use. The money vault is able to lock and move funds to and from the lending protocol to facilitate any funding. More vaults will be built for other asset classes / contract standards: ERC721 etc
